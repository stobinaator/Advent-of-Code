Each day's folder holds an input file with test-data, my solution and a Joel Grus' solution, which is not just copied, rather, watched a video and understood his way.</br>

°1:code for the first part was really ugly, but worked, could not manage to solve the second. got help from Ilia.</br>
°2:first done. for the second - joel's code did not work (it is not complete, gave up). ilia's worked.</br> 
°3:first done, complexity was too high for the second. got implicit hints from ilia, still had to see his solution to understand it fully.</br>
°4:first done, understood how the 2nd should be done, help from ilia.</br>
°5:first done, second was somewhat more complex. checked joel's solution - much, much smarted.</br>
°6:first day - help for both from joel's video. at least had an idea and made an attemp!</br>
°7:no idea how to do it. at all. - help for both.</br>
°8:own code works with example input. need help for real input.</br>
°9:got it working for the first part, the second part wanted really big computation and my solution didn't work. found a really good one on reddit.</br>
