Each day's folder holds an input file with test-data, my solution and a Joel Grus' solution, which is not just copied, rather, watched a video and understood his way.</br>

°1:code for the first part was really ugly, but worked, could not manage to solve the second. got help from Ilia.</br>
°2:did the first one. for the second - joel's code did not work (it is not complete, gave up). ilia's worked.</br> 
°3:did the first one, complexity was too high for the second. got implicit hints from ilia, still had to see his solution to understand it fully.</br>
°4:did the first one, understood how the 2nd should be done, help from ilia</br>
