Each day's folder holds an input file with test-data, my solution and a Joel Grus' solution, which is not just copied, rather, watched a video and understood his way.</br>

- [x] D25: √ 8 more stars for the second °15


°1: code for the first part was really ugly, but worked, could not manage to solve the second. got help from Ilia.</br>
°2: first done. for the second - joel's code did not work (it is not complete, gave up). ilia's worked.</br> 
°3: first done, complexity was too high for the second. got implicit hints from ilia, still had to see his solution to understand it fully.</br>
°4: first done, understood how the 2nd should be done, help from ilia.</br>
°5: first done, second was somewhat more complex. checked joel's solution - much, much smarted.</br>
°6: first day - help for both from joel's video. at least had an idea and made an attemp!</br>
°7: no idea how to do it. at all. - help for both.</br>
°8: own code works with example input. need help for real input.</br>
°9: got it working for the first part, the second part wanted really big computation and my solution didn't work. found a really good one on reddit.</br>
°10%11: joel</br>
°12: jonathan paulson, because joel's code wasn't completed</br>
°13: had the right idea, but got it wrong somewhere. I was trying to solve it by more complicated way than needed</br> 
°14: this was a hard one</br>
°15: actually the task was easier than it looked</br>
°16: first: understood why I wasn't able to get the answer. the second part was too hard</br>
