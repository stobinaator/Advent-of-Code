°1: code for the first part was really ugly, but worked, could not manage to solve the second. got help from Ilia.</br>
°2: first done. for the second - joel's code did not work (it is not complete, gave up). ilia's worked.</br>
°3: first done, complexity was too high for the second. got implicit hints from ilia, still had to see his solution to understand it fully.</br>
°4: first done, understood how the 2nd should be done, help from ilia.</br>
°5: first done, second was somewhat more complex. checked joel's solution - much, much smarted.</br>
°6: first day - help for both from joel's video. at least had an idea and made an attemp!</br>
°7: no idea how to do it. at all. - help for both.</br>
°8: own code works with example input. need help for real input.</br>
°9: got it working for the first part, the second part wanted really big computation and my solution didn't work. found a really good one on reddit.</br>
°10%11: joel</br>
°12: jonathan paulson, because joel's code wasn't completed</br>
°13: had the right idea, but got it wrong somewhere. I was trying to solve it by more complicated way than needed</br>
°14: this was a hard one</br>
°15: actually the task was easier than it looked</br>
°16: first: understood why I wasn't able to get the answer. the second part was too hard</br>
°17: this one was really hard to understand. the couple videos I've watched were really hard to follow</br>
°18: got the first part on piece of paper. got the code for the second, haven't checked it how it works</br>
°19: have to check and try to understand this one, it was hard</br>

°1 - I got the examples with recursion, after that it did not work. J.Paulson with the smart solution. Joel with deque idea.</br>
°2 - got the example. after that could not understand why I was getting my error. J.Paulson again with the nice solution. Joel with more verbose solution.</br>
°3 - could not think how to go deeper in either direction.</br>
°4 - got only the first part. J.Paulson helped again.</br>
°5 - got the first. Couldn't think out the modulo logic (beforehand) to make it faster.</br>
°6 - could not think of anything. I would not have been able to solve P2. joel used match-case from Python 3.10</br>
°7 - after seeing the solution, some of my ideas we in the right direction, but could not combine them</br>
°8 - partially understood the solution by J.Paulson</br>
°9 - interesting task</br>

°1 J. Paulson's solutions was cool. Managed to get the 1st + 2nd parts with regex. </br>
°2 J. Paulson's solutions were cool. In Part 2, I managed to replace the switch-case with Math.max() operation. </br>
°3 somehow for the 2nd part I was using the example numbers the whole time and not the input. smh :/ </br>
